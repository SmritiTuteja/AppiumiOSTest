iOS Automation using Appium
=============
Appium is an open source, cross-platform test automation tool for native, hybrid and mobile web apps, tested on simulators (iOS, FirefoxOS), emulators (Android), and real devices (iOS, Android, FirefoxOS)
This contains script for automating iOS Apps.


Advantages of using Appium -

[1] You don't have to recompile your app or modify it in any way, due to use of standard automation APIs on all platforms.

[2] You can write tests with your favorite dev tools using any WebDriver-compatible language such as Java, Objective-C, JavaScript with Node.js (in both callback and yield-based flavors), PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Clojure, or Perl with the Selenium WebDriver API and language-specific client libraries.

[3] You can use any testing framework.



One demo script has been added showing how to run tests. 
It includes :

[1] User authentication - signing in.

[2] Searching in an app

[3] Logging out.
